# Exercise 2

$m(1) = f_{11}$

$m(n) = min(m(n-i) + f_{in}), i \in n$

This is very similar to the rod cutting problem. Except we have to find the minimim fee instead of the maximum profit.

```
let m[1..n] be a new array
m[1] = 0
for j = 2 to n
    q = infinity
    for i = 1 to j
        q = min(q, m[n - i] + f[i][j])
    m[j] = q
return m[n]
```

Everything be the loops will take constant time, thus we get a run time of $\Theta(n^2)$, as both loops will depend on $n$.

```
[a -> [(b,2),(c,13)]
,b -> [(d,3),(e,5)]
,c -> []
,d -> [(a,2),(c,4),(e,1)]
,e -> [(c,4)]
]
```

### 2a
I will use Dijkstra's algorithm. I choose this algorithm as it is fast, it does not compute unneccecary information nor does it take into account unneccecary information, therefore it shoud be the fastest and simplest way to solve this instance of the coute finding problem.

### 2b
$a \rightarrow b \rightarrow d \rightarrow c$

## 3c
we relax the edges 8 times and improved 6 times.
